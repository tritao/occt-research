# Lane hub: shape-healing-analysis

_Generated by `tools/gen_overview_pages.py`. Edit only inside `MANUAL:*` blocks._

Focus: shape validation, fixing, and upgrades; typical entry points when dealing with imperfect input.

## Lane overview

<!-- MANUAL:LANE_OVERVIEW:BEGIN -->
- Boundary (in/out of scope): diagnosing/fixing imperfect shapes and recording modifications; excludes the downstream consumers (booleans/meshing/exchange) except as motivation.
- Canonical scenario: run `ShapeFix_Shape` on a problematic imported shape, then inspect DONE/FAIL flags and the reshape mapping to see what changed.
- Observable outputs: per-tool DONE/FAIL status; tolerance scans/min-max; reshaped subshape substitutions via `ShapeBuild_ReShape`.
- Key invariants/tolerances to remember: repairs are policy-driven (modes + tolerance bounds); many fixes adjust tolerances, so always track what was changed and why.

5–10 symbols max, higher-level than the dossier spine:
<!-- MANUAL:LANE_SPINE:BEGIN -->
- `occt/src/ShapeFix/ShapeFix_Shape.hxx` — `ShapeFix_Shape::Perform` (high-level façade)
- `occt/src/ShapeFix/ShapeFix_Root.hxx` — `ShapeFix_Root` (precision + tolerance bounds + context)
- `occt/src/ShapeFix/ShapeFix_Wire.hxx` — `ShapeFix_Wire::Perform` (wire repair pipeline)
- `occt/src/ShapeAnalysis/ShapeAnalysis_ShapeTolerance.hxx` — `ShapeAnalysis_ShapeTolerance` (tolerance scans)
- `occt/src/ShapeBuild/ShapeBuild_ReShape.hxx` — `ShapeBuild_ReShape` (record/apply substitutions)
