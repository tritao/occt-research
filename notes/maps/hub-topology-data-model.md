# Lane overview: topology-data-model

_Generated by `tools/gen_overview_pages.py`. Edit only inside `MANUAL:*` blocks._

Focus: topological data model and its invariants (shape types, locations, sharing).

## Lane overview

<!-- MANUAL:LANE_OVERVIEW:BEGIN -->
- Boundary (in/out of scope): shape identity/sharing, orientation/location semantics, traversal, and shape-keyed containers; excludes geometric meaning (curves/surfaces) except as attached “reps”.
- Canonical scenario: instance the same payload shape twice with different `TopLoc_Location`s and verify identity tiers (`IsPartner`/`IsSame`/`IsEqual`) while traversing with `TopExp_Explorer`.
- Observable outputs: how `TopTools_*` hashes/equality treat shapes; how location multiplication order affects placement; where orientation matters (and where it is ignored).
- Key invariants/tolerances to remember: `TopoDS_Shape` identity is multi-tier; many maps treat `(TShape, Location)` as identity and ignore orientation by design.
