Goal: generate a high-quality initial backlog for OCCT internal research.

Create an epic "OCCT mapping & navigation" with tasks:
- verify build + compile DB
- generate toolkit graph + include graph + package scan
- add a small script to locate symbol definition/references via occt-lsp
- create dossier template

Create an epic "Booleans deep dive" with tasks:
- oracle: fuse two boxes; print face/edge/vertex counts and volume
- dossier: BRepAlgoAPI entrypoints to BOPAlgo phases (PaveFiller + Builder/BOP)
- compare section: list 3 alternative boolean strategies and tradeoffs

For each task:
- Add a concrete implementation plan section
- Add acceptance criteria
- Keep tasks small and independently verifiable
