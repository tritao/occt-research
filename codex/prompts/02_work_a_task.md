You are assigned task(s): <TASK_IDS>.

Before writing code:
- Open each task file and write an "Implementation plan" (step-by-step).
- Identify which scripts/targets you will run (e.g., `just maps`, `just occt-build`).
- Identify outputs you will add (dossier markdown, oracle program, updated map files).

Then implement. Keep changes limited to `notes/`, `tools/`, `oracles/`, and Backlog task files.
